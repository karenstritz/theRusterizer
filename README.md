The Rusterizer
by Karen Stritzinger

This tool is dependent on a pipeline structure and set of tools developed at Clemson University in the Digital Production Arts program. See more information about this pipeline structure here: https://github.com/Clemson-DPA/dpa-pipe

Bits and pieces of the code could be reworked to fit the needs of your own personal project. If you have found any interesting uses for it or have included it in your work, I would love to hear about it.
